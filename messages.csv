jolyon scarlett we can blame big business but most of these problems occur due to the housing laws being flouted by certain unscrupulous landlords and local councils turning a blind eye to the overcrowding we do not have nowhere near enough housing for those that are already here whats the point of allowing immigrants in to the country in such huge numbers when we do not have the infrastructure to cope  shortages in housing  higher rental prices  more homeless  more suffering,Neutral,Irrelevant
 a sensible answer for once our immigration problem is not because you may be polish lithuanian hungarian indian chinese or any other nationality our issues are we dont have the infrastructure for the numbers that are coming it needs to be controlled better as we dont have the economy to react to the huge numbers coming in there are lots of people who flout the system both foreigners and the british its costing too much and preventing those in real need from getting the service they deserve we need a government with a backbone and an understanding of the real issues,Neutral,Irrelevant
